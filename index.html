                <h4>Problem Discovery</h4>
                <p>The initial phase involved identifying the disconnect between physical experiences and digital data records. Users often struggle to manage the vast amount of data generated daily, leading to information overload and loss of meaningful context. This stage focused on pinpointing these pain points to inform the system's architecture.</p>

                <h4>Solution Validation</h4>
                <p>To address the identified issues, I proposed a hybrid model that utilizes AI to categorize and process data automatically. The solution was validated through low-fidelity prototypes and user testing, ensuring that the backend logic effectively supports the user's needs without overwhelming them with complexity.</p>
